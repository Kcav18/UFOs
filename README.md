# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filters we added previously, the user will be able to filter by the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The finished product is shown below:

This webpage has a table that contains all of the UFO sitings around the world. Because the table is so large, there are filters created on the left side of the page to allow users to filter based on several different criteria (date of sighting, city, state, country, and shape).

To perform a filtered search, the user must enter their desired criteria into one or more of the emply filter boxes and press enter. This will filter the table data to only show the UFO information that meets their criteria. To clear the filters and start over, simply delete the criteria from each entry box and press enter.

An image of the available filter boxes is shown below:

## Summary

This is a great beginner tool to filter through UFO sightings. One major drawback to this design however is the inablity to click a "search" or "clear" button. Most people are used to clicking search, whether it is on Google, Amazon, or any other major website. Not having these buttons could potentially confuse the user. Having to press "enter" after deleting the search criteria is not something most are probably familiar with. It would definitely be more "user friendly" if "search" and "clear" buttons were an option. 

A few recommendations for further development of this site are below:

* The addtion of a "search" and "clear" button under the filter paramaters. This would make the site feel more familiar and user-friendly.
* I think it could also be useful if the headers on the UFO table could have filters applied to them as well. This would allow the end user to sort each column into ascending or descending order.
* An option to export the table and/ or filter results could also be useful so that people could do their own analysis of the data.
